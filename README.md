This controller replaces the cable bound remote control for a 2-Color USB LED bar and includes an ESP32-WROOM-32 for connecting it to home automation

The board also features a USB-C port for power, a 3-Pin PH2.0 plug for connecting the LED bar and four buttons to control power, brightness and light-temperature. 

All parts on the top side are selected from the JLCPCB basic library for cheap production. The ESP module and the connectors need manual soldering on the bottom side unless two-sided pcb assembly is used.
